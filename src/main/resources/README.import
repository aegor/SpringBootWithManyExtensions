If spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update, then import.sql will not run.
Hey I came across similar issue. My sql script was not getting invoked initially. 
Then I tried renaming the file from "import.sql" to "schema.sql", it worked. 
May be give this a shot. My code can be found here - https://github.com/sidnan/spring-batch-example
